# YOLO-projecet
Go-rani Team: The Core Electrical Engineering Club for Graduation Projects


This project prevents accidents on curved road blind spots using a YOLOv5 deep learning system. It utilizes webcams for real-time detection of vehicles, animals, and people across five zones, alerting drivers with corresponding color-changing LED logo-lights. Additionally, the system includes a Bluetooth-enabled button on streetlights to quickly summon a dedicated cleanup team in the event of roadkill, enhancing safety and mitigating secondary accidents.
